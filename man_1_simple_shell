.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh reads commands from the user in a loop, executes built-in commands like "env" and "exit",
or launches external programs in subprocesses. It also handles environment variables, basic signal management
(e.g., CTRL+C), and searches the PATH for external commands.
The shell continues to prompt for commands until the user exits.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
env
Prints the current environment variables.
.TP
exit [STATUS]
Exits the shell with an optional exit status (0-255). If STATUS is omitted, the exit code from the last command is used.
.SH EXTERNAL COMMANDS
Any command not recognized as a built-in is searched in the PATH and executed in a subprocess.
