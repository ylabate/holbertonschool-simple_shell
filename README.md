# **holbertonschool-simple_shell**

## **Description**

This repository contains the simple-shell project that was given to us to do in pairs by Holberton School as part of our learning program.

The goal of this project was:

- To train ourselves to work as a team
- To design a simple and valid flowchart
- To work while respecting the contrainst imposed by the checker
- To translate a diagram into working a C code
- To write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

This repository provides:

- A complete and validated flowchart
- The corresponding C implementation
- The compiler corresponding to the simple-shell project

Here is the list of allowed functions and system calls+:

- all functions from string.h
- access (man 2 access)
- chdir (man 2 chdir)
- close (man 2 close)
- closedir (man 3 closedir)
- execve (man 2 execve)
- exit (man 3 exit)
- _exit (man 2 _exit)
- fflush (man 3 fflush)
- fork (man 2 fork)
- free (man 3 free)
- getcwd (man 3 getcwd)
- getline (man 3 getline)
- getpid (man 2 getpid)
- isatty (man 3 isatty)
- kill (man 2 kill)
- malloc (man 3 malloc)
- open (man 2 open)
- opendir (man 3 opendir)
- perror (man 3 perror)
- printf (man 3 printf)
- fprintf (man 3 fprintf)
- vfprintf (man 3 vfprintf)
- sprintf (man 3 sprintf)
- putchar (man 3 putchar)
- read (man 2 read)
- readdir (man 3 readdir)
- signal (man 2 signal)
- stat (__xstat) (man 2 stat)
- lstat (__lxstat) (man 2 lstat)
- fstat (__fxstat) (man 2 fstat)
- strtok (man 3 strtok)
- wait (man 2 wait)
- waitpid (man 2 waitpid)
- wait3 (man 2 wait3)
- wait4 (man 2 wait4)
- write (man 2 write)

It's one possible solution among others, but here's the one we came up with by creating our flowchart.


**Ajouter Flowchart**

## **Objectives**

At the end of the simple-shell project, we should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of google:

- Work collaboratively within a group of peers
- How our flowchart works and how we translated it into C code
- To be able to explain all the steps of all our codes
- Explain clearly how program work
- Read and design a flowchart describing program logic

## **Requierement**

The program for our simple-shell project will be compiled using:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
- The code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No more than 5 function per file
- All our header files should be include guarded
- The prototypes of all our functions are included in our header file called "main.h".
